Wanted to make note of a few burrs in the views (mostly within the edit views) which will need to be addressed in the templates (with some arbitrary javascript) or elsewhere...

Also, and this is already part of the plan, but the collect-close button and the way the modals are styled will need to be adapted to the views themselves.

There are only 2 edit views but they are meant to be rendered in a 4 different situations:

List Edit View
  - The placeholder says 'name your new list'
    - when editing a list (not adding) it would be more appropriate to say 'rename' and the submit button to be labeled '+update'

Item Edit View
  - placeholders will need to be replaced or left to their original setting
  - as with the list edit view, 'update' is a more appropriate submit label
